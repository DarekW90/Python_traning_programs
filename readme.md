### About me and my plans.

Hi!
My name is Darek and at this moment I have only one simple wish... --(dont waste time for everyday drive to work and back :) )-- ... Ok...Ok...
Honestly, I don't see any problem with getting to the office :)
I just dont want to work with my bare hands anymore. I'm just tired, so from this came out my motivation to become a developer.

I've started to learn over 1 year ago, and now when I quit my job at the end of August, I want to spend lots more time on learning and practicing my skills.
Also I'm a second-year computer science student with a programmer specialty.

My stack isn't very big at the moment, but give me some time... I promise that my stubborn nature and my hard work will do some good soon.
At the moment I have beginner knowledge about: 
    
        Frontend:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JavaScript

        Backend:
    - C#
    - PHP
    - MySQL


But I fell in love with Python.

<b>And this is my first ever portfolio.</b>
